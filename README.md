1.Abstract 
The "University Online Survey System" is a Java-based GUI application designed 
to collect feedback from students regarding different services at the university, 
including cafeteria, transport, faculty, library, and mosque. The system provides a 
simple interface for students to respond to surveys and allows administrators to 
manage and review feedback. The project uses Java Swing for GUI, file handling 
for data storage, and includes various Java core concepts. This application aims to 
enhance decision-making based on student opinions and improve university 
services. 
 
2. Introduction: 
In today's educational environment, student feedback is critical for improving 
institutional services. Traditional survey methods are time-consuming and 
inefficient. Our project solves this by implementing an automated Java-based survey 
system using a graphical interface. It enables real-time data collection and simplifies 
feedback processing for administrators. 
 
3. Objectives: 
 Develop a simple and user-friendly GUI for conducting surveys. 
 Allow participants to select categories and submit responses. 
 Enable admin access to view, search, count, or delete responses. 
 Store responses securely using file handling. 
 Ensure the use of key Java programming concepts. 
 
 
  
 
 
 
4. Tools and Technologies: 
 Java SE (Standard Edition) 
 Java Swing – for GUI design 
 File Handling (java.io) – for reading/writing data 
 NetBeans / Vs Code used for development 
 JDK 8 or above – Java Development Kit. 
 
 
5. System Functionality: 
The project contains two main modules: 
 Student/Participant Side: 
 Select survey category (e.g., Cafeteria, Transport, etc.) 
 Answer predefined questions 
 Submit name and responses 
 Responses saved to responses.txt 
 
 Admin Side: 
 Admin login with password 
 View all responses 
 Search responses by participant name 
 Count total responses 
 Delete all responses 
 
  Survey Categories Include: 
 Cafeteria 
 Transport 
 Library 
 Masjid 
 Faculty
